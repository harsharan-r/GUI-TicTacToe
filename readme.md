# TicTacToe

Here is the classic Tic Tac Toe game recreated in a visually and audibly appealing GUI with PyGame. It is only a multiplayer game at the moment, but will soon have an AI to face against. To play download all the files and make sure the assets folder is in the same folder as the rest of the files, then run the Main.py file in CMD and enjoy!
